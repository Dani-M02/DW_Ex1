        <text>
            Hi! My name is <b>Daniela, I'm 21</b> and I'm from the north of Portugal, the shoe's capital, <b>Felgueiras</b>. I could
            go study design for that area,
            but I decided to choose another type of design. Got my degree in <b>Design e Multimédia in Faculdade de
            Ciências e Tecnologia of Universidade de
            Coimbra</b> between 2020 and 2023, and at the moment I'm doing the masters of the same course.
            While I depeen my knowlegde in Design, Media e Programming, I'm also trying to start my professional career
            in Visual Arts, more precisely <b>Illustration
            and Animation</b>, sharing my work on social media and doing commissions per request.
            My interests are considered more on the "nerdy" side. I'm a fan of anime, mangá/webtoons and videogames,
            being perticulary interested in fantasy themes.
            Music is also one of my fonts of inspiration, being open to anything but my top of choice are Indie, Rock e
            Phonk.
